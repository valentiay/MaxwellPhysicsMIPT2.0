# MaxwellPhysicsMIPT3.0

Simulation of Maxwell, Boltzman distributions and some other thermodinamical things. Made for oral physics exam in 
MIPT in june 2017 by Vasiliy Morkovkin and Alexander Valentinov.

This repository was aimed to make MaxwellPhysicsMIPT2.0 more object-oriented, though I didn't have enough 
motivation to continue. Most likely code here does not work properly. For working project (I suppose it was quite cool) 
see original repository: https://github.com/susliko/MaxwellPhysicsMIPT2.0 . This one is archived now.
